                <p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering came into being in the year 1946 and the first batch of Mechanical Engineers graduated in the year 1949. The department was renamed as Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering on its silver jubilee in 1974 when an undergraduate programme in Industrial Engineering was started. At present it offers both undergraduate and postgraduate courses in various facets of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.</p>

                <p>The Department of Chemical Engineering was established in 1963 with an Undergraduate programme in Chemical Engineering. A Master’s course in Equipment and Plant Design was initiated in 1970. Later on, two new Master’s courses namely Industrial Pollution Abatement and Advanced Transfer Processes were inducted. Subsequently, the specialisation of Equipment and Plant Design was redesigned, updated and re-christened as Computer Aided Process Plant Design. </p>
